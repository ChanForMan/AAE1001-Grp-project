## Background of Path Planning to Aviation Engineering
Path planning (also known as the navigation problem),can be simply said as its literal meaning, implies
moving the sepcific object from the source to destination.The term is
widely used in robotics and computer games, espcailly in Aviation.

Aa aviation has become important,if not essential in the transportation system,Path PLanning is needed in 
Private pilots do the path plan before the flight to make sure the
navigation aid is available
For ATC near airports, collaborative path planning is required to make
the best use of the crowded airspace
Commercial pilot follow the path that plan based on different cost index
designed by airlines.

#### Map Set-Up
Our porject uses x-y coordinate plane as a simplfied map for Path-planning simulation.Blue and Green points on the map are respectively indicated as the Start and Goal nodes,the khaki filled places represents Fuel-consuming area and Pink filled places represents Time-consuming area.Bold lines such as the inclined line from (10,40) to (20,20), or the vertical line from (40,60) to (40,35) are the obstalces which the path can't pass through.
