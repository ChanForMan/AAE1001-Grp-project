Aircraft name : A322

Passenger capacity : 273

Engine count: 2 

Calculation: 

Introduction of aircraft:
A322 is a new type of the A320 family, upgrade of the current A321-XLR. A322 will have similar wing design (foldable wingtip) like the B777-9X and with wider fuselage than A321.

Carring capacity of A321-XLR is 220, a wider fuselage allow A322 to increase carring capacity by 53 passengers. 

Reduce flight time:

A322 will have similar wing design (foldable wingtip) like the B777-9X. Foldable wingtip allows aircrraft to have longer wingtip in-flight,
induced drag can be reduced.

Riblets surface will also be used on A322 aircraft skin. The longitudinal grooves of the riblets create distance between the vortices and the wall surface, they also lessen the
resistance caused by vortices by reducing the contact area and thus reducing the skin friction drag.

With lower drag, A322 flies faster with the same constant fuel consumption rate, reducing flight time, thus time cost and fuel cost can be reduced

Why A322 is suitable in our scanrio ?

Capacity of A322 will carry all 3000 passenger in 11 flights. Total seat avalible on this route will be 3003 while the current demand is 3000. Flights will fly in almost full load,
maximizing load factor which also indicates the effectiveness of the flight. 

Maximum flight allowed on the route is 12 and the required flight to meet current demand is 11. Leaving room of one more flight to meet demand growth.
Maximum carring capacity of the route is 3276, 276 more seats can be provided in case of demand growth. 

Other avantages:

Reduce crew training cost: It is saved since A322 will be part of A320 family. The avionics system, cockpit design, aircraft system (electric, hydraulics, PACKs) design will be very
simliar to A320. Allowing A320 type rated pilot and cabin crew to operate A322 and A320 type rated maintanance team to service A322 with some extra training. No new type rating training
required save a huge amount of training fee. 

Reduce maintanance cost: A lot of parts and components of A322 can be used on A320 family aircrafts, vice versa. Reducing inventory cost for airlines,which currently operating 
A320 family fleet. Most equipments and crew used for maintaining A320 family can also be used for A322 maintanance, reducing maintanance cost. 

Larger aircraft but no increase in parking fee: Although A322 has a longer wingspan, on ground the wingtip can be folded. Making the on ground wingspan 35.8 metres same as A321. 
Aircraft with wingspan less than 36 metres is under code C of ICAO aerodrome refrence code, A322 will be allowed to taxi on code C taxiways and code C parking stands.
Parking fee in a airport usually consider the wingspan of the aircraft, since A322 can be parked can stands that are smaller where large wingspan is not allowed to park. The parking 
fee will be same as A321. However, runway usage fee will be higher due to higher wake turbulance category but it is unavoidable since the weight of aircraft increases.
