Introduction of aircraft:
A330-X is a new generation of A330, upgrade of the current A330-neo. A330-X will have similar wing design (foldable wingtip) like the B777-9X.

Reduce flight time

A330-X will have similar wing design (foldable wingtip) like the B777-9X. Foldable wingtip allows aircrraft to have longer wingtip in-flight,
induced drag can be reduced.

Riblets surface will also be used on A330-X aircraft skin. The longitudinal grooves of the riblets create distance between the vortices and the wall surface, they also lessen the
resistance caused by vortices by reducing the contact area and thus reducing the skin friction drag.

With lower drag, A330-X flies faster with the same constant fuel consumption rate, reducing flight time.
